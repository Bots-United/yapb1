%v, you're no match for me!
Sorry, %v. You got in my way.
You flew back pretty good, %v.
I had to do it, %v. You understand.
You should've run while you had the chance, %v.
I've always been better, %v. Always.
I bet you hate it when that happens, don't you, %v?
That'll teach you, %v!
Hey, come on, %v! You almost hurt me this time.
Ha...ha!
You are nothing, %v. Nothing at all.
%v I worry about you...
Sorry %v, my Headshot Script is better than yours.

[DEADCHAT]
It makes me sick to look at those Fools
It's time for a mapchange, isn't it?
%t GO,GO,GO!!
I'm so booored!
I can't believe %f isn't cheating
Spectating sucks...
I wish someone good would join the server.
That looked painful.
This is quite fun.
%r in the round and I'm already spectating :(
Why does everyone keep trying to hurt me :)
Visit http://podbot.nuclearbox.com
My handwrist already hurts...
This Map sucks hard...
I'm having a bad day
%r and %t is still alive! Something must be wrong...
Will they stop camping now? Only %r left!!
I'm better at Quake 3, that's for sure!
Still %r in this round 
Botman must be such a cool guy...
Stupid Bots!
Look at those idiots!
I bet %t won't make it through the round
I'm so tired today...
I really should go to bed now.
I usually don't play that bad!
No %m today, please!
I really hate %m :(
Sniping is all they can do.
Do you know Bots-United?
LOL! Look at %t!
Please vote for a mapchange!!!
Did one of the bots get stuck already?
Boooooom!!! *lol*
Insane in the membrane, hehe!
I'm sure that Guy used an Aimbot!
HEY %f YOU DAMN CHEATER!
Are there bots in this Game?
Would you give me your Headshot Script?
Next Round we should stick together.
Fuck all those Teamkillers!!!
Woah %f has nice stats!!
What are Clans all about? I don't get it
Do you know Jumbot? It really kicks Ass!
If botman is cool, what is TheFatal then?
Fucking lagged!!
IMHO NNBot is much better than RealBot.
Too bad Android Bot is updated so slowly.
I'm off for a cigarette break...
Why did they include the vehicles in CS?
I had to reload and he shot me in the head!

# Start of the "dynamic" replies from here
# After each @KEY Tag you need to specify the
# keywords in quotation marks and uppercase. You can
# have several keywords (aliases) each separated by a comma.
# After the keywords line, the answers or messages to this
# special keyword need to be given. In theory there can be an unlimited
# number of answers of course you should care about the used memory ;)

@KEY " AGAIN "
%s, things are always repeating - aren't they?
And I'm sure it wasn't the last time...
That's the way things go, hey...

@KEY "AIMBOT", "WALLHACK"
%s, are you cheating?
Even PunkBuster fails to detect some of them...
You can't be sure nowadays if someones's good at playing or cheats
Aimbots are cool, shut up %s!
Wallhacks are evil tools of the devil ;)

@KEY " ALWAYS "
That's not always, %s!
I just like it :-)
Come on %s, that was only the second time!

@KEY "ANDROID"
Ah yes, those were the times...
%s was it your first Bot too?
Does anybody know what DaTa does today?
You can't play with Android on %m, can you?

@KEY "BOTMAN"
Who is this botman everybody is talking about???
Visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman
Without his source code many bots wouldn't exist!
I wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
Did you play his HPB-Bot yet?

@KEY " BOT ", "BOTS"
Why are you always talking about them?
There are no bots on this server %s, I tell you!
Bots are cool!!!
What's your favorite bot, %s?
If you want to program your own, ask botman!
Bots, all the time bots - you should start playing with humans.
Most bots are still very stupid!

Camping sucks!

@KEY " CLAN "
What are these clans all about?
I was in a clan once, but it sucked hard.

@KEY " CS ", "COUNTERSTRIKE", "COUNTER-STRIKE", "CSTRIKE"
Counter-Strike is boring nowadays...

CS all the way from the very first beta!
There are too much newbies playing it.
Too many people online cheat in CS
It's not as much fun as it used to be

@KEY " DOD ", "DAY OF DEFEAT"
I don't get what people like in DoD
CS all the way...
%s do you think it will get as popular as CS?
%s do you prefer DoD over CS?
Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD, IMHO.

@KEY " ENGINE "
I heard the HL Engine is a hybrid between Quake1 & Quake2, odd huh?
%s, don't you miss the time when an engine was a Software Engine?
The HL Engine is still quite good, despite its age...
Code your own engine %s!

@KEY "FUCK", "DAMN", "PISS"
Don't swear, %s!
Nasty %s!

@KEY "NNBOT"
Too bad NNBot is discontinued...
Try JoeBot if you liked NNBot %s
%s did you hear of Ditlew's new MOD?

@KEY "PARABOT"
ParaBot is a the coolest Deathmatch Bot I've ever played
%s you should try ParaBot, it's great!
It's so sad no CSBot has the great Nav of Parabot so far
I heard it already supports 3 HL MODS by now
It just crashes a lot on my computer

@KEY " PING ", "LAGG"
I always have a Ping of 5, I'm on DSL!!
My connection sucks...
Where are you from %s?
Play offline with Bots if your connection sucks
Just change your provider %s!

@KEY "POD-BOT", " POD ", "PODBOT"
I heard it's the best bot for CS, I'm not sure though...
Yeah, it rulez!
People tell they use some kind of wallhack, is it true?
I wonder what CF is up now
POD-Bot source code has already been released, don't you know %s?
There're too many PB clones, E[POD]bot, IvPBot, POD-Bot mm, YaPB...

@KEY "PUNKBUSTER"
Don't be a PUNK! (support www.punkbuster.com)
I'm always lagging when using PunkBuster

Q3 has a bad lighting IMO
Half-Life still rules %s!
So many FPS games are based on Quake engine
Have you heard of DMC, %s? ;-)

@KEY "REALBOT", " RB "
Is RB still unwaypointed %s?
Is Tub still working on RB? I have asked Stefan but he didn't answer me
RB is too laggy, and I only have a slow computer
I wonder why they removed it from the official CS web site
Have you got the latest WIP?
Visit http://realbot.bots-united.com
Stefan isn't lonely now, evy joined the team

@KEY "SCRIPT"
Scripts are for losers
%s, you prolly don't know how to bind keys?
Did you know that even buying scripts are considered cheating?

@KEY "SERVER"
I'm always on this server
Me & my friends play a lot on this server
I believe this server's got a good map rotation

@KEY "SORRY"
Yeah, afterwards everybody says he's sorry!
The excuse doesn't help me now, %s!
Next time you better think before you start doing something, %s!
I'm sorry, too!
You don't know how sorry you will be for doing that...

@KEY "TEAMKILL", " TK "
Teamkillers should be banned from this server.
Who's the teamkiller %s?

Dunno.
What do you think %s?
I won't tell you, %s!
Find out yourself, %s!
Good question, %s!

@KEY "POXBOT", "POX-BOT", "STEVE++"
I wonder why POX-Bot is removed from the Bots-United
It's just a POD-Bot fixup, no really new features
Looks like Steve++ is nowhere to find... dunno what he's up now
Try E[POD]bot and IvPBot if you like POX-Bot, %s!

@KEY "YAPB", "WHISTLER", "WEI MINGZHI", "WEI-MINGZHI"
I still prefer POD-Bot mm
Even it's first version is also quite stable

Yet another POD-Bot clone...

Why is Whistler's real name so difficult to spell?

There is also United-Admins, do you think its a conspiracy?

@KEY "RACC", "PIERRE-MARIE BATY", " PMB"
That's a good unwaypointed bot, don't you think?
PMB must be such a cool guy

Do you know PMB is also working on HPB-Bot and POD-Bot?
I wonder when RACC will be completed...

@KEY "JOEBOT", "@$3.1415RIN", "AS3.1415RIN"
What's the meaning of '@$3.1415rin', %s? I just can't understand
Visit http://joebot.bots-united.com
Funnily JoeBot got famous when NNBot quit...
I wonder where else Neural Networks could be applied
Do you know JoeBot XP, %s? I'm sure it will be cool

@KEY "AKIMBOT", "BLUESY"
It supports a whole load of mods, but it's just too dumb
Is bluesy from Israel?
Looks like it's just botman's bot with additional mods support
Visit http://akimbot.nuclearbox.com
It's a pity that bluesy lost his source code

@KEY "STEAM"
Steam just sucks!!!
What's your Steam nickname, %s?
How long did you take to download CS on Steam?
I wonder what will happen if Valve turn off their Steam server... :P

Concentrate on the game, %s!
Chatting with you %s is so great!
These damn chat-messages are freaking me out!
Don't spam, %s!
How do you find the time to type all this crap???
Yeah, %s. You're right!
No way, %s...
Where are you from, %s?
I can't believe how you can play and type at the same time, %s!
Are you sure, %s?
I see, %s!
Why is everybody always saying the same things???
What the heck are you talkin' about, %s?
Hey, shut up and play, %s!
You said somethin', %s?
Who said that?
Oh, really?
Very funny, %s!
I'm in the best clan of my country!
I hate these stupid comments, %s!
