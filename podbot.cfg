//                    someone, if the Bomb was planted or if they are dead

//
// yapb addbot [skill] [personality] [team] [name] - Adds a Bot using a Skill from 0-100,
//      team is 1 for Terrorists, 2 for Counter Terrorists and 5 to

//      chosen and the Bot will be auto-assigned with a Name he chooses
//      randomly from "Botnames.txt". You can edit this File to add some
//      names you like better!
//

//		       weapons and only use the knife for combat! Greets

//			 [POD] before the name
//
// yapb_inhumanturns <1|0> - If you think that a Skill 100 Bot is too weak for
//			  you, you can turn this on to have that unfair
//			  turning from previous versions again. Note that
//			  this overrides the turn amounts in botskill.cfg
// 
// yapb_followuser <number> - Sets the maximum number of Bots in the team to
//			    follow the same user (when Radio Command
//			    "Follow Me" is used). Default is 3

//			    shoot through Walls if they saw an enemy or if
//			    they heard someone on the other Side of a Wall

// Any other commands in the bot.cfg file will be treated as server
// commands.  For example, you can use "map mapname" (without the quotes)
// to select a specific map, or you can use "mp_forcerespawn 1" to turn
// on force respawn, or "kick #1" to automatically kick player number 1.
//

// This sets the Waypoint Folder (in the yapb directory)
// for loading/saving waypoints. Don't use a trailing backslash or spaces.
