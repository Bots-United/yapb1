# In this File you can tweak some of the POD-Bot
# Skill Settings
# As usual the "#" char starts a comment line
# NOTE: If you have inhumanturns turned on in
# podbot.cfg the turnspeeds here will be overridden

# MIN/MAX_DELAY specifies the Reaction Time in Seconds
# AIM_OFFS_X/Y/Z are the offsets for aiming (note that HL uses
# the lefthanded coordinate system where Z is the Up Direction)
# HEADSHOT_ALLOW specifies (in percent) the probability of aiming
# at the Head. This doesn't mean he actually fires at your head
# but he is allowed to do so.
# HEAR_SHOOTHRU_PROB specifies (in percent) the probability of shooting
# through Obstacles if the Bot has heard someone, has a weapon to do so
# and has this enemy in his viewing cone. 
# SEEN_SHOOTHRU_PROB specifies (in percent) the probability of shooting
# through Obstacles if the Bot has seen this enemy before, has a weapon
# to do so and this enemy is still in his viewing cone. 

# The order is from the Worst Bots to the Best. DON'T CHANGE THE
# ORDER IN THIS FILE UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE WEIRD THINGS!
